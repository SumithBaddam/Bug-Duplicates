Train different models...

1. Sentences need to go through Word2Vec/Doc2Vec and find the similarity - 1 attribute

Here Doc2Vec is unsupervised model. Can be used to find similar bugs. ---Not working properly. Try to convert them to word2vec matrix and find cosine similarity
Word2Vec can be used for word embeding and then train it using CNN.

2. Structural data need to be embedded for 2 bugs and then cosine simiarity need to be found for these 2 bugs

Embed the two bugs structural data and pass it to CNN with prediction as 1/0. This is like XOR case.

3. Use both these similarities and predict
For testing bug, if we get 1 for any bug then we should see if the sentences are also similar.
