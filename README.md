# Bug-Duplicates
# Intelligent defect creation using CNN- LSTM networks

Pro-actively identifying and predicting bug duplicates from Cisco Software Defect Creation tool.
When a new bug is file reported, predicting if it is a duplicate of an existing bug in the system and retrieving the similar bugs from the past. 
Solution includes using Siamese CNN and LSTM networks for retrieval of duplicates/similar bugs.
